# Mainly Idea
---
There are mainly two families of neural density estimators that are both flexible and tractable:
- Autoregressive models decompose the joint density as a product of conditions, and model each conditional in turn.
- Normalizing flows transform a base density into the target density by an invertible transformation with tractable Jacobian.
