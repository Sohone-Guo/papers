Affine transformation is easy to compute inverse, but may limit the expressiveness of a models.

Recently invertible piecewise polynomial functions as a replacement for affine transformation have attracted attention. But it require solving a polynomial equation to calculate their inverse.

	- ChatGPT: In a linear rational spline, the function is divided into multiple intervals or segments, and within each segment, the function is defined as a linear combination of rational functions. The rational functions consist of the quotient of two linear polynomials.
