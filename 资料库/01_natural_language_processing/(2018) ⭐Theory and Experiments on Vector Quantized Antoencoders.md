# Mainly Idea
---
Deep neural network with discrete latent variables offer the promise of better symbolic reasoning, and learning abstractions that are more useful to new tasks.



# Reference
---
VQ-VAE: The method uses a learned code-book combined with nearest neighbor search to train the discrete latent variable model.[[(2018) Nerual Discrete Representation Learning]]
